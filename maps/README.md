#### Overview

These maps have been generated automatically using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and are now available for use in Replicar-lite.

#### Updates & Enhancements

- Version Adjustment: The maps have been updated from ASAM OpenDRIVE 1.4 (originally extracted in 2021) to the latest ASAM OpenDRIVE 1.6 standard.
- Automated Processing: The map creation involved an automated pipeline that made necessary adjustments to the raw OSM data.

#### Important Notes

- Geo-referencing: As these maps are derived from OSM data, there may be slight discrepancies in geo-referencing. Consequently, the map data may not perfectly align when projected onto satellite views.
